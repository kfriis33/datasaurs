            <ul>

                    We collected two types of data: number of twitter posts about climate change and
        weight of recycling in four U.S. cities. To get the twitter data, we used a package

        Summary of challenges and observations
        </h3>
        <p>
        One challenge we faced was that the recycling data from the four cities was
        in different forms and units. In order to aggregate it all together, we
        had to convert it...
